# Learn Unity

This segment of "Learn" focuses on the Unity engine.

Yes, as time progresses this is going to be a mix of pre-canned tutorials and other learning examples.

## Prepping the Projects

### Setup

1. Download Visual Studio
2. Include the Workload, _**Game development with Unity**_

### Git Ignore

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) is the official one from GitHub. To function correctly, it must be placed in the root of each project folder, not the root of the repository.

## Projects

### Games

* Lego Micro-game - _Unity sample game with basic physics, collision detection, and enemies_

### VR

* VR Template Test - _Bare-bones project for the Meta Quest 2_

### Misc
